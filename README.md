# Binary Conversions
Running binary_converter.py provides a script that converts unsigned binary to decimal, it imports the necessary functions for conversion from binary_functions.py.

## This project practices a few key concepts: 

* exception handling
* data validation
* importing modules
* algorithm design

The file binary_functions.py is a module with functions to convert binary to other number bases. As of right now, it has one algorithm 
for converting unsigned binary to decimal.

## Goals for the future:

* add an algorithm for conversion to hexadecimal
* support for signed binary values
* simple GUI
