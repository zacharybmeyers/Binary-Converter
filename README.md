# Binary Conversions
Running `BinaryConverter.py` provides a Python script that converts unsigned binary to decimal, 
it imports the necessary functions for conversion from `BinaryFunctions.py`.

## This project practices a few key concepts: 

* exception handling
* data validation
* importing modules
* algorithm design

`BinaryFunctions.py` is a module with functions to convert binary to other number bases. 
As of right now, it has one algorithm for converting unsigned binary to decimal.

## Goals for the future:

* add an algorithm for conversion to hexadecimal
* support for signed binary values
* simple GUI
